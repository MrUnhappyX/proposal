# Strategic Qubic - Monero Quorum Decision

## Proposal
Do you (the Computors) want to start orphaning Monero blocks of other Monero miners when the Qubic contribution to Monero network exceeds 51% of the total hashrate?

### Available Options:
> Option 0: No, I don’t want

> Option 1: Yes, go ahead

## Details

An entity controlling 51% or more of the hashrate of a PoW cryptocurrency has an option of earning 100% of the emission (and fees) by making blocks mined by the others orphaned.

Such “51% attack” doesn’t actually harm anybody and isn’t perceived as a bad deed according to this pool: [https://x.com/c___f___b/status/1932028222415237325](https://x.com/c___f___b/status/1932028222415237325).

Qubic computors may increase their revenue (and revenue of their miners) should the Quorum choose this course of action for Monero.

In such case the other actors will get the following benefits:
- Monero users - reduced fees (even zero fees if there is enough block room) as a tribute to Qubic’s feelessness;
- Monero miners - increased revenue, because mining Qubic is more profitable than mining Monero;
- Monero pool operators - chance to integrate into the Qubic ecosystem and expand their userbase by adopting existing Qubic miners;
- General cryptocommunity - practical test of a 51% attack and possibility to analyze its impact on XMR price, which we believe won’t be negative.


## Disclaimer
Be aware, that a true 51% attack can undermine trust, trigger chain splits, or invite counter‑measures. Acknowledge potential reputational or network‑security impacts.
There may be more conservative members that might worry about “chain death” or exchanges delisting XMR with this action.
