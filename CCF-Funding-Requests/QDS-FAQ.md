# Qubic Development Services

This is an FAQ developed to properly respond to questions from the Qubic community around the development of QDS.

ðŸš¨ **_Please read the following Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) for responses_** ðŸš¨

## FAQ

### Organizational things

Q. Who should verify if the deliverables meet the needs after 31.07 and if the 200k should be paid out?

A. As stated in the proposal I would recommend the CCF or even QCT designate a Q/A team or individual, I consider this a function of the ecosystem team and it may be best for them to do so.  I consider ecosystem a complimentary function not a competitive one.

Q. Would it be possible to set a price/number for each product you plan to deliver? (Reasoning behind: If we have a number/price per product, it would also allow for clear partial payment for the deliverables)

A. I can speak with the team and get one based on skill alignment.  As some projects require a different level of skill, for example Rust devs for the Solana bridge.

Q. What partnerships/sources do you expect to be self funded?

A. I expect to receive funding over time from teams using the tools, looking for tooling to be built and even teams looking to leverage the expertise of go to market strategies for their products.  This isn't just a build to suit, there has to be a developed market presence to create demand and drive interest from parties outside our typical ecosystem.  This is how projects like Qubic reach the billions in SC.  For example at Protocol Labs a partnership was formed with Lockheed Martin and the use of IPFS.  These partnerships not only bring revenue but catch many retail eyes that drive up retail investment and boost market cap.

Q. Encapsulating all planned related activities from marketing to development in one compact proposal makes it easy for the network to consume while building a focused team with a specific purpose. what will differ your marketing offers to what is offered by jens marketing workgroup?

A. As stated in the channel this is a pure go to market approach which differs from marketing.  Go to market is focused on product release and proliferation.  Pure marketing is focused on bringing relevance and attention to already existing products, these indeed are also complimentary functions.

Q. How would you differentiate your services from existing Ecosystem team? (e.g. Allocates a small business development team to pursue academic and research engagement by pushing these tools externally.)

A. Ecosystem team is a complimentary function to what we do.  Their focus is working on teams that are pursuing grants and bringing their own ideas to the ecosystem.  They are the gate keepers of a grant treasury and perform criticial Q&A activities on released products.  The goal should be to support ecosystem with these tools making their engagements easier, the more efficiently they can support external dev teams the better they can focus on managing the quality of releases and stengthening existing partnerships for long term sustainability.
 
### Finance
Q. Who will pay the salary of the dev's until August?

A. The devs salaries are paid by ARData tech who is very successful with web3 projects.  Not only do they have positive cash flow but they also have other engineers working on other projects at their disposal to bring in revenue while the core 15 are focused on these particular projects.  As an aside they wrote the Qubic connector for this network and were paid in Qubic, they have held their Qubic and it has significantly matured in value since they were paid and are still holding to this day.  They have also built solutions like this:

https://delta.storage which bring run rate revenue.  This is a driver behind the method used to create this structure for QDS.

Q. Are the operational costs fixed in $ amount? (e.g. for 3 month of work you request 200k$; Aug-Oct you will release 200k$ in Qubic)
At which date (range) do you plan to do the follow-on proposal?

A. When August rolls around a follow-on proposal would be created to cover any new projects that have been incubated through business relationships or to cover any added scope work.  For example if the ecosystem brought more desired functions to the IDE we would caluclate the delta to cover those additions and generate a proposal that would include based on needed salaries and team members.  If come August nothing needs to be built ARData has the ability to provide 3 months of product support and engineers could be allocated to other projects they are working.  

Q. If your services are paid in Qubic, do you plan to vest them too for a certain period or would you need to convert them to USD to cover costs?

A. This will be conditional, some will want to sell them to cover the next 3 month run rate gap while others may hold.  Each dev will have their own option.  As stated above however due to its success ARData is still holding their Qubic payment from the Connector they built and have other revenue streams that they have captured over time.  One reason I am doing the proposal in this fashion is they are just as motivated as the Qubic community is to see a token succeed.

Q. By removing a large swath of tokens from circulation it is a great market signal is this referred to the funds that are "locked" into Qearn?

A. Yes ... the bigger the swath of tokens and showing the community the commitment of locking funds is a positive market signal that we are building with the desire to provide price growth for the token.  Their ability to deliver and pay staff is contingent on keeping the schedule and promoting token growth as it should be for any team in the Qubic community.  Thankfully due to their cash flow they have been able to sustain a treasury allowing them to put a team in place for three months to deliver solutions and assist with socials to help drive positive market impact.

Q. What monthly costs do you estimate to operate your services (smart indexer, IDE, solana bridge) after the initial funding?

A. A rollup $50K a month goes to the dev teams to be distributed by Alvin based on skill and function for his team.  They will cover the following:  dev, documentation and socials.  $10K per month to Jay to cover salary for developing go to market strategy and cover any expenses he endures, he will coordinate with the socials team to release product teasings to market and craft a web presence with mature socials.  $3K a month salary to me to chase partnerships and work with partners on go forward plans while stewarding the whole project.  $11K reserved to cover infra payments, web hosting and any advertising expenses around a blitzkreig go to market approach during the 3 months.  The plan is to cover infra out of that $11K for 12 months for sustainability anything left over can be cycled back into the funds for future use and if the token price increases we have buffer we can issue small bonus payouts for early completion.

Q. Do you plan to use cross funding for operating the services? (e.g. if you earn money from operating the solana bridge, will this funds be used to operate smart indexer and the IDE)

A. Yes or can be used to cover salaries to build even more features.

Q. What have you thought will be the rates for the services you want to offer to the Qubic ecosystem? (e.g. for dev hours, for marketing and so on)

A. This will be based on needed skill mix, senior devs are more expensive than junior devs and even Rust devs come with a higher premium.  We can do a statement of work on a case by case basis to be transparent with cost aggregates.

Q. Are the dev's paid individually in Qubic or will there be a contractor in between which does the conversion for the employees?

A. ARData agreed to a monthly lump sum and they allocate salaries from that lump sum.  As stated Rust devs are at a higher premium than a solidity dev for example.

### Personal understanding

Q. Another market signal is the formation of a group with a sole mission to make Qubic consumable for enterprise and research is this refering to smart indexer?

A. This goes above and beyond the indexer this would include the IDE as well.  Enabling more teams to build on Qubic is paramount.  As more devs have their barriers to entry for development reduced and more come online this is a positive growth signal.  Many projects are evaluated on ecosystem developer count as part of demonstration of growth.  We want that same social lever.

Q. Provide business development and marketing assistance to other teams within Qubic (depending on engagement level without fees). In the event more than 10 hours per week are needed an agreed upon contract rate must be paid in Qubic only to help drive buy pressure. are those 10 hours in for all requestors or each? could you give me an example on how such a service could look like?

A. Its 10 hours total for a discipline.  For example a team needs some dev help building an app over the smart indexer and the job takes 10 hours they get it free, they may also need consulting for roughly 20 hours for go to market to prepare a plan for product push.  They would get the dev hours free and a SOW would be drafted to cover the extra 10 GTM hours.  Or maybe a dev team needs to roll out an app quickly and need 30 hours of support, a SOW could be written to specify a price and deliverables for the extra 20 hour overage.

Q. Top of funnel pipeline is formed by business development to cultivate partnerships can you explain this on an example?

A. Forming business relationships like companies mentioned in the proposal (w3.io) is the goal.  W3.io is a company that builds SW recipes for businesses on top of existing web3 projects.  Both Alvin and myself worked with the CEO in a previous life and the goal is bring in recipes to tap into our neural networks and use our compute to perform enterprise level functions.  These are the types of relationships you lean into to bring enteprises into the fold as network consumers and creating a pipeline feeding the top of the business lead capture funnel.

Q. Directions for product deployment are provided to the community. did you already thought on how this can be achieved?

A. All projects are open-source and their READMEs will document how they can be deployed and used.  The team has an established history in building SDKs, solutions and documenting them very well.

Q. Audit access to a member of CCF to ensure code quality and safety. there is no entity CCF (CCF = Computor Controlled Fund) i suggest until we are missing the QCB to elect 1-3 direct auditors.  Access to expenses/receipts related to QDS activities to a member of CCF for audit. same as for point 5

A. This is where an ecosystem team could provide the support needed.

Q. Support data traffic by teaming with QCT to build and leverage oracles what means "Support data traffic"?

A. This refers to forming meaningful partnerships like the one with w3.io or even research universities that can create solutions leveraging our neural network compute in meaningful ways.  The more demonstrated use cases and data inflow/outflow to the network the better the social gravity achieved through publication and cross promotion (something the marketing team can leverage).

### Provided services and deliverables
Q. The proposal contains many different types of services. I assume that the team you will work with already has a track record. Could you share some of their products?

A. https://delta.storage -> they built it, operate it and make revenue from it.   
   https://www.koneksi.co.kr/ -> private IPFS cloud
   https://www.ironmountain.com/ -> built an RWA platform and solution over IPFS
   https://alkimiya.io/ -> trade on-chain resources

Q. Is the planned SC IDE a development completely from scratch or is it an existing product/approach that will be adapted for Qubic?

A. Technically built from scratch but I built a small MVP to show the concept (the same one I provided to Aleish before they threw together qubicdev).  The goal is to build a real robust IDE that has all the necessary features and have the capability to be extensible and add more functions as the network grows.  Much like as discussed in the proposal thread, follow on functions can be tackled in future proposals as the community cultivates more and more ideas.

Q. The Screenshot/Mockup from Indexer Explorer shows an SQL query that looks like it is used in an existing product for Solana. Will you adapt an existing product to Qubic?

A. Yes the images in the proposal are from an MVP built for Qubic to show quality of work.  It with a small slice of data with minimal function on a small VM.  The goal is to make it network grade and run over all the chain data.  The data can be archived on Functionland for long term retention to solve the storage problem Qubic currently faces.

Q. What are the deliverables regarding the Solana bridge?

A. The team is currently designing the bridge to be similar to that of the Vottun project.  The bridge web interface, a wQubic token on Solana and the middleware necessary to handle the bridge transactions.

Q. The deliverables for the IDE are all not Qubic related. Could could you also add some deliverables which are Qubic specific?

A. Don't truly understand the question, the deliverable for the IDE is wholly Qubic focused.  The integrations mentioned are to support Qubic development and using Github as the repository to hold the contracts for community reviews much like they are performed today.

### Technical curiosity

Q. You mentioned that you do not recommend to create a VSCode plugin because of security. What editor engine will you use for the IDE?

A. Web based IDE

Q. Can you tell me a few words about w3.io? What it is, what could be the potential partnership?

A. As explained above w3.io takes blockchains and develops SW recipes over the top to create consumable solutions for enterprises.  We would be looking to build solutions that leverage our neural networks and drive external engagement.

Establish new development paradigms and drive use of testnet and mainnet. what would be those new development paradigms?

Q. if i understood you right, the planned IDE will be a Web IDE. how do you plan can this IDE interact with e.g. qubic core test instances?

A. That functionality will be added in the future and due to the work Aleish has done the blueprint has been laid to do it relatively quickly.

Q. What is the reason to maintain two separate entities that appear similar? Why not enter as an incubation project or sub-squad: it would create:
one coherent developer toolchain roadmap
unified demarketing voice much simpler
CCF oversight
flexibility for QCS talent to earn larger budgets as milestones are hit

A. As explained above these entities have different focuses and capabilities.  This can be seen as the blueprint for building a product or products and building a business around it.  The CCF will not live in perpetuity and external streams of revenue need to be a focus.

Q. You've mentioned you're planning to tackle three projects at once. Why not deliver the solana bridge first, and then move on to the next phase? Again I think an incubator proposal makes more sense. Especially considering Alvin and his team worked like this in the past and can work according to milestones.

A. To take advantage of deployment around the halving and quickly engage more developers before the bullrun takes full hold.  This puts in a better position to start capturign retail investment and separate ourselves from projects of this type or market cap.  I am a fan of striking when the iron is hot.  Building them in serial means slower time to capitalize on the developed projects as a whole.

Q. How do you intend to collaborate with other core teams? There's no mention to that in the proposal. I'd love to know how you plan to work together with ecosystem, marketing, operations and core tech. There's one mention about working together with QCT on the development of oracles.

A. Mentioned this above.

Q. I would love to see in your proposal who's in your team? 

A. It is a portion of Alvins team and if he wishes to share their CVs I will leave that up to him however I have yet to see this asked of any team doing grants or incubation and I have seen 6 figure grants so why now?  Their product delivery speaks for itself.  Qubex outsourced their entire dev activity set on their grant and no resumes were collected and they were a third party grant recipient.

Q. If you decide to move forward as an entity this is important so there's accountability and not a conflict of interest.

A. I am more curious as to how a conflict can arrive as a separately funded entity as we already have some of that going in within the Qubic ethos that is far more upfront and visible.  An external entity with the mission of building a team to cultivate business is far more straighforward then the system we have now.  There is a significant lack of accountability which effects timelines, here we have a team that won't taky any payment until finished.

Q. Can you give an example of what a GTM strategy would look like? Currently QCS is the only group that has a mandate from quorum to present Qubic externally.

A. A go-to-market (GTM) strategy and a marketing strategy are two distinct but related concepts in business. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key differences:

Go-to-Market Strategy:
Focus: GTM strategies are specifically designed to bring a new product or service to market. They focus on the initial launch and ensuring that the product is placed in front of the right audience and that potential customers understand its uses and benefits.
Components: GTM strategies include product segmentation, pricing and packaging, channel strategy, sales enablement, and market validation. They also calculate the size of the opportunity and develop a business case for the product.
Duration: GTM strategies are typically short-term, lasting around 6-9 months, and involve a lot of validation work to ensure the product meets market needs.
Example: For a new software product, a GTM strategy might involve identifying the target market, setting up distribution channels, pricing the product, and creating promotional activities to attract initial customers.
Marketing Strategy:
Focus: Marketing strategies are broader and focus on the ongoing efforts to promote products and services, build brand awareness, and generate demand. They cover aspects such as branding, messaging, content creation, campaigns, and channel selection.
Components: Marketing strategies are developed after the product launch and evolve with market feedback and changing customer needs. They aim to retain and grow the customer base over time.
Duration: Marketing strategies are long-term, typically spanning around 12 months or more, and are designed to build and maintain a competitive advantage in the market.
Example: For an established software company, a marketing strategy might involve ongoing content marketing, social media campaigns, email marketing, and customer retention programs to keep existing users engaged and attract new ones.
In summary, a go-to-market strategy is a short-term, product-specific plan focused on the initial launch and market entry, while a marketing strategy is a long-term, organization-wide plan focused on ongoing promotion and customer retention.

We will have core products that we are bringing to market and draw an audience.  Jen and her team would add this to her portfolio downstream while she focuses on things already built.  GTM is not pure marketing.  The goal is to bring immediate traction to items as they release, and start obtaining early adopters.  A core function of any business is and should be go to market, big boy projects have this as well.

Q. There's a mention in your proposal you want to handle exchanges listings and market makers. Currently this is a combined workstream between ecosystem and other members of QCS. I believe LFG and his team also do some work there. Why not combine this in one combined effort?

A. It is not a desire to handle them in general however through recent relationships this team has the ability to potentially deliver this.  In the past I have seen an issue where multiple teams trying to accomplish this stalled an exchange listing for Qubic.  If I can deliver on this that is the goal ... I would not be out actively seeking to list but if the opportunity arises bring it to Qubic.  However the power of professional relationships helps make this happen and handing it off at times can damage that, I am not going to cite examples here but we know it happens.

### Follow on questions from 4/28-29

Q. one q came to mind: did you think about fee/burn economics in the bridge, already? As you know Qubic is special in this regard and I wonder what model you plan to use.

A. We were considering the Vottun model tbh â€¦ we want to ensure consistency across the community while at the same time using fees that we know voters are comfortable with.

Q. Can you explain that model?

A. The Qubic Token Bridge implements a transfer fee mechanism to cover operational costs and incentivize operators.

Base transfer fee: The base fee is configured by the Admin and is expressed in basis points (1 basis point = 0.01%).

Operator fee percentage: For each token transfer transaction (execute, confirm, revert), the operator can opt to receive the full fee or a part of it, allowing for fair compensation for their role in the transaction. It is expressed as a percentage of the base fee (no decimal places).

The final fee is deducted from the transfer amount as follows:

transfer_fee = transfer_amount * base_fee/10000 * operator_fee/100 (rounded up)
final_amount = transfer_amount - transfer_fee

The deducted fee is transferred to the recipient designated by the operator for that transaction, allowing for separate storage of funds.
That is how Vottun does it in their solidity contract on Arb.
Itâ€™s set by admin in this method but is specified by a range of 0 to 10000 basis points:

function setBaseFee(uint256 _baseFee) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
        if (_baseFee > 100 * 100) {
            revert InvalidBaseFee();
        }
        baseFee = _baseFee;
        emit BaseFeeUpdated(_baseFee);
    }

Personally I would lean towards a fixed base fee. 
Which might be better from a transparency perspective.

Q. While being in crypto for quite long I barely used bridges (security concern), therefore my understanding is limited:

There is code on both sides:
Qubic (which needs and SC)
Solana (also an SC or smth called differently)

I assume also fees are created on both sides?
bridge from QUBIC to Solana --> fees in Solana
bridge from Solana to QUBIC --> fees in QUBIC

A. state.transactionFee = 1000;
Yes there is a transaction fee

Q. To clarify my question about IDE is not Qubic related:

you list:
User Authentication Flow using Multifactor Auth for security
GitHub Authentication support
IDE Development and easy loading capabilities
GitHub Integration for Code Push & PR Creation
Draft Saving & Recovery

this are all features i would expect from every IDE. It's not Qubic related. A deliverable for me for Qubic would e.g. be The autocomplete suggets automatically the functions available via QPI or The IDE creates automatically a summary if an SC is conform with the SC Guidelines/Rules of Qubic

A. Yes the intent is to take existing and future SCs and add them to the IDE baseline via administrative function and autocomplete on the public and protected (in the case of inheritence) methods and structs provided in the contract.  In the IDE mockup the Utilities dropdown would allow direct selection of the methods of each contract while autopopulating the necessary structs for things like input, output & local.

Q. Some things i do not agree or i'm missing based on your proposal, the discussions and the Q&A:
Building an IDE from scratch is imho an unneeded investment
I personally do not know any developer who uses a Web IDE for real work

A. Remix and Openzepplin are changing how development is done specifically for blockchain.  Why liimit yourself to having maintain a local environment when the blockchain is easily accessible from anywhere?  For example I have two laptops and have to update my dev environment on both for things like foundry and hardhat as new solidity versions roll out, if I use remix that problem is gone.  In the enterprise world the reason to have segmentation of your dev environment is protection of IP or in the case of my early roles at Lockheed security.  This barrier to entry is no longer a thing, why not have an IDE that you can access openly from any machine allowing you to quickly develop and prototype an SC or application?

Q. f you have made an MVP for Qubic i cannot understand how an SQL query like select date_trunc(day, block_timestamp) as date, case when succeeded then 'Succeeded' else 'Failed' end as status, count(*) as N_Transactions from solana.core.fact_transactions where block_timestamp > current_ate - 60 group by 1,2 came into the mockup. This Query is clearly not Qubic related and that is the reason why i asked if you use an existing product and adapt it for Qubic. (btw. this Question was not answered)

A. This was my fault I used the wrong images, the images provided were from initial mockups used to build the MVP.  You can access the MVP here:  

Use queries like this and watch the table update, also note query speed on this subset of sample data in text field top right:
https://qubic-indexer-explorer.vercel.app/

SELECT * FROM transactions where amount < 7
SELECT * FROM transactions where amount > 100

Q. "Establish new development paradigms and drive use of testnet and mainnet." what would be those new development paradigms?

A. This is about allowing development from anywhere via web based IDE and integration with github and in a follow on proposal adding support for things like testnet and mainnet.  Our development process could become more streamlined and BTW build into the IDE the ability to directly submit a proposal downstream giving you a one stop shop to do what is needed to see a contract from start to finish.  Reducing developer friction and ramp up time to learn all the steps will help bring in more talent and allowing them to have a faster impact as the IDE is developed and futures are added.  The goal is to make building an initial contract all the way to deployment more seemless.

Q. The mentioned payment/salary numbers do not completely match, but i understand that you calculate with a rising price.

A. The request was for 143 billion at $1400 per billion or $200K.  Breaking down the salary distro goes as follows:
$50K per month for 3 months to cover AR Data 15 person staff -> $150K
$3K per month for project lead (could be me or someone else) -> $9K
$10K per month for Jay King for salary and expenses -> $30K

The remaining $11K was earmarked for 12 months of infra to support all developed projects and other expenses.  That rounds out to $200K
It should also be noted that 120 discipline specific hours are also being given to the network gratis on top of this, which could roll up to 360 total hours of free time across dev, gtm and bd.

Q. Imho one of the core functions/deliverables for the IDE project should be somehow the availability of Debugging/Test

A. Planned for future, due to the nature of Qubic this is a difficult lift but something on the roadmap.

Q. I'm missing focus. the three projects could all be realized on their own. no need to put them together. maybe i miss some synergies.

A. Again this is about truncating the schedule and bringing them to market prior to halving and subsequent bull run.  If done in serial you turn a 3 month schedule into a 9 month schedule and miss your window.  This is structured with the purpose of taking advantage of what we see as a bullish second half of the year.

Q. As you were NA representative : were the 3 projects part of your plan and what you would have brought to qubic?

A. The IDE was something I brougth up when I first joined back in Oct of last year Joetom and Alberto can confirm this.  The smart indexer came along as an idea when we were dealing with storing the data for RPC during a conversation with Luk he wanted a solution that could allow queries of this manner.  This was a topic of conversation with Functionland and identified as a need.  We will be able to not only allow the queiries he desired but have a backend archival solution that is highly durable and available built in.  For those curious you can also run functionland on your own and be paid for provisioned storage creating a small alternative revenue stream.  The bridge was ideated our of a conversation with a few community members and has even been discussed in discord channels.  A solana bridge also gives us rapid access into the US market where we lack exchange access.

Q. then why you think it requires to create new Group that have the same functionality  as  existing group ? what this new group will be able to avoid  from the previous position you had?

A. As stated above this is not an analgous function it is a complimentary function.  GTM is different than marketing and ecosystem is a complimentary function to what we are building for the reasons stated above.

Q. I have worked within a decentralized structure for many years ...mainly in inverted pyramid model . The concept of creating any working group is the need of certain service that governing bodies (comps in our case) can't conduct as it requires a certain kind of professionalism that might not be available. as the groups been created consequently, it's delegated the authority to make decisions within it's borders with accountability for sure on those decisions hence in our case what I see that the decision of creating a group that has similar function of existing group belongs to the same existing group not Comps as it's falling under existing group decision making border and for budget Comps has to approve it for sure but in the larger sense of the main group. so how I see is that  QDS is a subcommittee from the current Ecosystem group, and it should fall under its jurisdiction not to be created as peer-to-peer working group!

A. Comps still have to have a significant role in this ... smart contracts still need approval.  We are not a subcommittee to ecosystem in any way shape or form as our business model is inherently different with different goals.

Q. The idea of self-sustainability is really great but again as Comps created that groups to further the success of the project, there are responsibility that falls under Comps to provide the funds required & guidance all the time ,, your approach of working groups investing in Qearn  or  whatever to get yields and sustain themselves looks good from outside  but when yields become massive then we will start having problems IMO and it will divert working groups from their main purpose, working group should focus mainly on it's purpose that created for therefor it should not be bothered  actually about finance ( I know it's not the case in qubic as every 2-3 months you have to get approval on funding - which I believe it should be changed in more efficient  way to make sure no work group will be put on pause due to this)

A. This is literally a problem with a network as a whole.  The difference is where the accountability lies for managing the financials as we strive for independence from the CCF.  The CCF should be used to fuel business innovation, incubating projects is great but funds do run out as we burn and more are locked.  The main purpose of the group is to properly manage budget over time so they decrease the need for funding and allow the CCF to fund other initiatives.  If an independent entity dies it doesn't impact the network in its entirety however if you bleed the CCF too quickly it will.
