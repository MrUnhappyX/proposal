## FAQ

### Organizational things

Q. Who should verify if the deliverables meet the needs after 31.07 and if the 200k should be paid out?

A. As stated in the proposal I would recommend the CCF or even QCT designate a Q/A team or individual, I consider this a function of the ecosystem team and it may be best for them to do so.  I consider ecosystem a complimentary function not a competitive one.

Q. Would it be possible to set a price/number for each product you plan to deliver? (Reasoning behind: If we have a number/price per product, it would also allow for clear partial payment for the deliverables)

A. I can speak with the team and get one based on skill alignment.  As some projects require a different level of skill, for example Rust devs for the Solana bridge.

Q. What partnerships/sources do you expect to be self funded?

A. I expect to receive funding over time from teams using the tools, looking for tooling to be built and even teams looking to leverage the expertise of go to market strategies for their products.  This isn't just a build to suit, there has to be a developed market presence to create demand and drive interest from parties outside our typical ecosystem.  This is how projects like Qubic reach the billions in SC.  For example at Protocol Labs a partnership was formed with Lockheed Martin and the use of IPFS.  These partnerships not only bring revenue but catch many retail eyes that drive up retail investment and boost market cap.

Q. Encapsulating all planned related activities from marketing to development in one compact proposal makes it easy for the network to consume while building a focused team with a specific purpose. what will differ your marketing offers to what is offered by jens marketing workgroup?

A. As stated in the channel this is a pure go to market approach which differs from marketing.  Go to market is focused on product release and proliferation.  Pure marketing is focused on bringing relevance and attention to already existing products, these indeed are also complimentary functions.

Q. How would you differentiate your services from existing Ecosystem team? (e.g. Allocates a small business development team to pursue academic and research engagement by pushing these tools externally.)

A. Ecosystem team is a complimentary function to what we do.  Their focus is working on teams that are pursuing grants and bringing their own ideas to the ecosystem.  They are the gate keepers of a grant treasury and perform criticial Q&A activities on released products.  The goal should be to support ecosystem with these tools making their engagements easier, the more efficiently they can support external dev teams the better they can focus on managing the quality of releases and stengthening existing partnerships for long term sustainability.
 
### Finance
Q. Who will pay the salary of the dev's until August?

A. The devs salaries are paid by ARData tech who is very successful with web3 projects.  Not only do they have positive cash flow but they also have other engineers working on other projects at their disposal to bring in revenue while the core 15 are focused on these particular projects.  As an aside they wrote the Qubic connector for this network and were paid in Qubic, they have held their Qubic and it has significantly matured in value since they were paid and are still holding to this day.  They have also built solutions like this:

https://delta.storage which bring run rate revenue.  This is a driver behind the method used to create this structure for QDS.

Q. Are the operational costs fixed in $ amount? (e.g. for 3 month of work you request 200k$; Aug-Oct you will release 200k$ in Qubic)
At which date (range) do you plan to do the follow-on proposal?

A. When August rolls around a follow-on proposal would be created to cover any new projects that have been incubated through business relationships or to cover any added scope work.  For example if the ecosystem brought more desired functions to the IDE we would caluclate the delta to cover those additions and generate a proposal that would include based on needed salaries and team members.  If come August nothing needs to be built ARData has the ability to provide 3 months of product support and engineers could be allocated to other projects they are working.  

Q. If your services are paid in Qubic, do you plan to vest them too for a certain period or would you need to convert them to USD to cover costs?

A. This will be conditional, some will want to sell them to cover the next 3 month run rate gap while others may hold.  Each dev will have their own option.  As stated above however due to its success ARData is still holding their Qubic payment from the Connector they built and have other revenue streams that they have captured over time.  One reason I am doing the proposal in this fashion is they are just as motivated as the Qubic community is to see a token succeed.

Q. By removing a large swath of tokens from circulation it is a great market signal is this referred to the funds that are "locked" into Qearn?

A. Yes ... the bigger the swath of tokens and showing the community the commitment of locking funds is a positive market signal that we are building with the desire to provide price growth for the token.  Their ability to deliver and pay staff is contingent on keeping the schedule and promoting token growth as it should be for any team in the Qubic community.  Thankfully due to their cash flow they have been able to sustain a treasury allowing them to put a team in place for three months to deliver solutions and assist with socials to help drive positive market impact.

Q. What monthly costs do you estimate to operate your services (smart indexer, IDE, solana bridge) after the initial funding?

A. A rollup $50K a month goes to the dev teams to be distributed by Alvin based on skill and function for his team.  They will cover the following:  dev, documentation and socials.  $10K per month to Jay to cover salary for developing go to market strategy and cover any expenses he endures, he will coordinate with the socials team to release product teasings to market and craft a web presence with mature socials.  $3K a month salary to me to chase partnerships and work with partners on go forward plans while stewarding the whole project.  $11K reserved to cover infra payments, web hosting and any advertising expenses around a blitzkreig go to market approach during the 3 months.  The plan is to cover infra out of that $11K for 12 months for sustainability anything left over can be cycled back into the funds for future use and if the token price increases we have buffer we can issue small bonus payouts for early completion.

Q. Do you plan to use cross funding for operating the services? (e.g. if you earn money from operating the solana bridge, will this funds be used to operate smart indexer and the IDE)

A. Yes or can be used to cover salaries to build even more features.

Q. What have you thought will be the rates for the services you want to offer to the Qubic ecosystem? (e.g. for dev hours, for marketing and so on)

A. This will be based on needed skill mix, senior devs are more expensive than junior devs and even Rust devs come with a higher premium.  We can do a statement of work on a case by case basis to be transparent with cost aggregates.

Q. Are the dev's paid individually in Qubic or will there be a contractor in between which does the conversion for the employees?

A. ARData agreed to a monthly lump sum and they allocate salaries from that lump sum.  As stated Rust devs are at a higher premium than a solidity dev for example.

### Personal understanding

Q. Another market signal is the formation of a group with a sole mission to make Qubic consumable for enterprise and research is this refering to smart indexer?

A. This goes above and beyond the indexer this would include the IDE as well.  Enabling more teams to build on Qubic is paramount.  As more devs have their barriers to entry for development reduced and more come online this is a positive growth signal.  Many projects are evaluated on ecosystem developer count as part of demonstration of growth.  We want that same social lever.

Q. Provide business development and marketing assistance to other teams within Qubic (depending on engagement level without fees). In the event more than 10 hours per week are needed an agreed upon contract rate must be paid in Qubic only to help drive buy pressure. are those 10 hours in for all requestors or each? could you give me an example on how such a service could look like?

A. Its 10 hours total for a discipline.  For example a team needs some dev help building an app over the smart indexer and the job takes 10 hours they get it free, they may also need consulting for roughly 20 hours for go to market to prepare a plan for product push.  They would get the dev hours free and a SOW would be drafted to cover the extra 10 GTM hours.  Or maybe a dev team needs to roll out an app quickly and need 30 hours of support, a SOW could be written to specify a price and deliverables for the extra 20 hour overage.

Q. Top of funnel pipeline is formed by business development to cultivate partnerships can you explain this on an example?

A. Forming business relationships like companies mentioned in the proposal (w3.io) is the goal.  W3.io is a company that builds SW recipes for businesses on top of existing web3 projects.  Both Alvin and myself worked with the CEO in a previous life and the goal is bring in recipes to tap into our neural networks and use our compute to perform enterprise level functions.  These are the types of relationships you lean into to bring enteprises into the fold as network consumers and creating a pipeline feeding the top of the business lead capture funnel.

Q. Directions for product deployment are provided to the community. did you already thought on how this can be achieved?

A. All projects are open-source and their READMEs will document how they can be deployed and used.  The team has an established history in building SDKs, solutions and documenting them very well.

Q. Audit access to a member of CCF to ensure code quality and safety. there is no entity CCF (CCF = Computor Controlled Fund) i suggest until we are missing the QCB to elect 1-3 direct auditors.  Access to expenses/receipts related to QDS activities to a member of CCF for audit. same as for point 5

A. This is where an ecosystem team could provide the support needed.

Q. Support data traffic by teaming with QCT to build and leverage oracles what means "Support data traffic"?

A. This refers to forming meaningful partnerships like the one with w3.io or even research universities that can create solutions leveraging our neural network compute in meaningful ways.  The more demonstrated use cases and data inflow/outflow to the network the better the social gravity achieved through publication and cross promotion (something the marketing team can leverage).

### Provided services and deliverables
Q. The proposal contains many different types of services. I assume that the team you will work with already has a track record. Could you share some of their products?

A. https://delta.storage -> they built it, operate it and make revenue from it.   
   https://www.koneksi.co.kr/ -> private IPFS cloud
   https://www.ironmountain.com/ -> built an RWA platform and solution over IPFS
   https://alkimiya.io/ -> trade on-chain resources

Q. Is the planned SC IDE a development completely from scratch or is it an existing product/approach that will be adapted for Qubic?

A. Technically built from scratch but I built a small MVP to show the concept (the same one I provided to Aleish before they threw together qubicdev).  The goal is to build a real robust IDE that has all the necessary features and have the capability to be extensible and add more functions as the network grows.  Much like as discussed in the proposal thread, follow on functions can be tackled in future proposals as the community cultivates more and more ideas.

Q. The Screenshot/Mockup from Indexer Explorer shows an SQL query that looks like it is used in an existing product for Solana. Will you adapt an existing product to Qubic?

A. Yes the images in the proposal are from an MVP built for Qubic to show quality of work.  It with a small slice of data with minimal function on a small VM.  The goal is to make it network grade and run over all the chain data.  The data can be archived on Functionland for long term retention to solve the storage problem Qubic currently faces.

Q. What are the deliverables regarding the Solana bridge?

A. The team is currently designing the bridge to be similar to that of the Vottun project.  The bridge web interface, a wQubic token on Solana and the middleware necessary to handle the bridge transactions.

Q. The deliverables for the IDE are all not Qubic related. Could could you also add some deliverables which are Qubic specific?

A. Don't truly understand the question, the deliverable for the IDE is wholly Qubic focused.  The integrations mentioned are to support Qubic development and using Github as the repository to hold the contracts for community reviews much like they are performed today.

### Technical curiosity

Q. You mentioned that you do not recommend to create a VSCode plugin because of security. What editor engine will you use for the IDE?

A. Web based IDE

Q. Can you tell me a few words about w3.io? What it is, what could be the potential partnership?

A. As explained above w3.io takes blockchains and develops SW recipes over the top to create consumable solutions for enterprises.  We would be looking to build solutions that leverage our neural networks and drive external engagement.

Establish new development paradigms and drive use of testnet and mainnet. what would be those new development paradigms?

Q. if i understood you right, the planned IDE will be a Web IDE. how do you plan can this IDE interact with e.g. qubic core test instances?

A. That functionality will be added in the future and due to the work Aleish has done the blueprint has been laid to do it relatively quickly.

Q. What is the reason to maintain two separate entities that appear similar? Why not enter as an incubation project or sub-squad: it would create:
one coherent developer toolchain roadmap
unified demarketing voice much simpler
CCF oversight
flexibility for QCS talent to earn larger budgets as milestones are hit

A. As explained above these entities have different focuses and capabilities.  This can be seen as the blueprint for building a product or products and building a business around it.  The CCF will not live in perpetuity and external streams of revenue need to be a focus.

Q. You've mentioned you're planning to tackle three projects at once. Why not deliver the solana bridge first, and then move on to the next phase? Again I think an incubator proposal makes more sense. Especially considering Alvin and his team worked like this in the past and can work according to milestones.

A. To take advantage of deployment around the halving and quickly engage more developers before the bullrun takes full hold.  This puts in a better position to start capturign retail investment and separate ourselves from projects of this type or market cap.  I am a fan of striking when the iron is hot.  Building them in serial means slower time to capitalize on the developed projects as a whole.

Q. How do you intend to collaborate with other core teams? There's no mention to that in the proposal. I'd love to know how you plan to work together with ecosystem, marketing, operations and core tech. There's one mention about working together with QCT on the development of oracles.

A. Mentioned this above.

Q. I would love to see in your proposal who's in your team? 

A. It is a portion of Alvins team and if he wishes to share their CVs I will leave that up to him however I have yet to see this asked of any team doing grants or incubation and I have seen 6 figure grants so why now?  Their product delivery speaks for itself.  Qubex outsourced their entire dev activity set on their grant and no resumes were collected and they were a third party grant recipient.

Q. If you decide to move forward as an entity this is important so there's accountability and not a conflict of interest.

A. I am more curious as to how a conflict can arrive as a separately funded entity as we already have some of that going in within the Qubic ethos that is far more upfront and visible.  An external entity with the mission of building a team to cultivate business is far more straighforward then the system we have now.  There is a significant lack of accountability which effects timelines, here we have a team that won't taky any payment until finished.

Q. Can you give an example of what a GTM strategy would look like? Currently QCS is the only group that has a mandate from quorum to present Qubic externally.

A. A go-to-market (GTM) strategy and a marketing strategy are two distinct but related concepts in business. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key differences:

Go-to-Market Strategy:
Focus: GTM strategies are specifically designed to bring a new product or service to market. They focus on the initial launch and ensuring that the product is placed in front of the right audience and that potential customers understand its uses and benefits.
Components: GTM strategies include product segmentation, pricing and packaging, channel strategy, sales enablement, and market validation. They also calculate the size of the opportunity and develop a business case for the product.
Duration: GTM strategies are typically short-term, lasting around 6-9 months, and involve a lot of validation work to ensure the product meets market needs.
Example: For a new software product, a GTM strategy might involve identifying the target market, setting up distribution channels, pricing the product, and creating promotional activities to attract initial customers.
Marketing Strategy:
Focus: Marketing strategies are broader and focus on the ongoing efforts to promote products and services, build brand awareness, and generate demand. They cover aspects such as branding, messaging, content creation, campaigns, and channel selection.
Components: Marketing strategies are developed after the product launch and evolve with market feedback and changing customer needs. They aim to retain and grow the customer base over time.
Duration: Marketing strategies are long-term, typically spanning around 12 months or more, and are designed to build and maintain a competitive advantage in the market.
Example: For an established software company, a marketing strategy might involve ongoing content marketing, social media campaigns, email marketing, and customer retention programs to keep existing users engaged and attract new ones.
In summary, a go-to-market strategy is a short-term, product-specific plan focused on the initial launch and market entry, while a marketing strategy is a long-term, organization-wide plan focused on ongoing promotion and customer retention.

We will have core products that we are bringing to market and draw an audience.  Jen and her team would add this to her portfolio downstream while she focuses on things already built.  GTM is not pure marketing.  The goal is to bring immediate traction to items as they release, and start obtaining early adopters.  A core function of any business is and should be go to market, big boy projects have this as well.

Q. There's a mention in your proposal you want to handle exchanges listings and market makers. Currently this is a combined workstream between ecosystem and other members of QCS. I believe LFG and his team also do some work there. Why not combine this in one combined effort?

A. It is not a desire to handle them in general however through recent relationships this team has the ability to potentially deliver this.  In the past I have seen an issue where multiple teams trying to accomplish this stalled an exchange listing for Qubic.  If I can deliver on this that is the goal ... I would not be out actively seeking to list but if the opportunity arises bring it to Qubic.  However the power of professional relationships helps make this happen and handing it off at times can damage that, I am not going to cite examples here but we know it happens.
