# Proposal to add state variables for additional metrics in QEarn Smart Contract

## Proposal
Allow to add following variables for tracking additional metrics directly in the QEarn Smart Contract to ensure full transparency on epoche level:

>burnedAmount

>boostedAmount

>rewardedAmount

This way we ensure that the full set of metrics is directly calculated and stored in the SC and can be used and displayed wherever needed.

## SC state change
This change requires a state change of the QEarn SC.
Additional needed actions for Computors to validate QEarn SC state will be posted in the #Computor-Operators channel in discord.

## Available Options
> Option 0: no, dont allow

> Option 1: yes, allow
